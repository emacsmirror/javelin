;;; Commentary:

;; This is a plugin based on harpoon from vim (by ThePrimeagen).
;;
;; It is a buffer quick-bookmark manager on steroids. Each "bookmark" is called a harpoon
;; position, and you can easily assign and delete buffers to harpoon positions. Harpoon
;; positions are namespaced by project and branch if within a git repository. Otherwise,
;; just by project if not within git. Globally namespaced otherwise.
